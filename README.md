# Python-Simple-CRUD-Project

Re-Create a simple console CRUD program from @kelasterbuka online course that which implements all the material learned from basic python programming from @kelasterbuka.
This program has a function to save data into a local database, namely the weapon.txt(can be modified) file.
This program has the following features:

1. Create database.txt automatically if the file does not exist.
2. Read the entire contents of the stored data and then display it.
3. Add data to the database.
4. Delete existing data in the database.
5. Update the data in the database.

**NOTE**

Please take a note, if you want to reuse this code for personal purposes, 
please pay attention to the data that can be modified and then replace everything related to it so that errors don't occur.
