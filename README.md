# Python-Simple-CRUD-Project

Create a simple CRUD program that will save data on characters in films into a local database, namely the database.txt file. 
This program has the following features:

1. Create database.txt automatically if the file does not exist.
2. Read the entire contents of the stored data and then display it.
3. Add data to the database.
4. Delete existing data in the database.
5. Update the data in the database.
